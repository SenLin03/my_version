Homework Management System
This system is aiming to provide a basic forum for
	Students to discuss and upload homework
	Teachers to manage the student users

It is based on Idea + Maven + SSM (Spring+Spring MVC+ MyBatis) + shiro + mysql + tomcat. The front-end UI uses AmazeUI. Cloud host uses AWS.
	Environment set up: http://blog.csdn.net/gallenzhang/article/details/51932152
	AmazeUI Introduction (http://amazeui.org/getting-started

Request Flow
View    ->   controller   ->   service   ->   dao    ->   entity
	Users interact with the view that generates the request. Requests are sent to the controller. Then, services and Dao are called, actions are performed, result in entity.



View（JSP pages），in the view directory
　   ▼
Controller，in the controller directory
　　▼
Busness logic Layer，in the service directory
　　▼
Data persistence layer，in the dao directory
　　▼
Entity Layer（JavaBean），in the entity directory

When modifying the layers, it is recommended to modify from the bottom layer to the top layer
Entity Layer
1.	First, Modify the entity
a)	User (id, username, password, email, etc)
b)	Homework (title, content, etc)
c)	Weather(temp, etc)
…
d)	Then, modify the Page class
MyBatis Interceptor prepares the sql requests and separates it in pages
public class Page<T>
　　　　			List<T> pageNo, pageSize, total
Data persistence layer，
2.	Modify the IUserDao
a)	get user information based on user name, email
3.	Modify the IRoleDao, IHomeworkDao
a)	Get the permission resource ID
...
Business logic Layer, service，mainly for Authentication
4.	Modify the UserService
a)	Change password …
b)	Modify the HomeworkService, dd HomeworkCommentService
5.	Modify the HomeworkService, HomeworkCommentService (common/service)
a)	Query paging data
…
Controller Layer, response to the request, implement the CRUD method
6.	LoginController.java登录权限，实现Filter接口，doFilter()方
a)	Login processing
b)	User registration
c)	forget password
7.	HomworkController, UserController, RoleController, etc
a)	Create the homework, User, Role
b)	Read the home work, User, Role
c)	Update the homework, User, Role
d)	Delete the homework, User, Role
8.	UserController，all the request from the /user，which follows the RequestMapping in the MVC framework
a)	Request / create (RequestMethodGET, POSt)
b)	Request / update (RequestMethodGET, POSt)
c)	Request / delete (RequestMethodGET)
…
…
For examples, in the request /*, if the request is /login, there is a Ajax login failed  handling。It calls the user service, the getter from UserUtils.getLoginUserName(), if the name does not match the database, the controller then throws an exception, username or password is incorrect.

If the request is /forgetpassword, it will use the userService to get user by user email to match the user. If such users exist and match, the email will be formed with a random password by using the randomString in the randomUtils service.

Sending the value from the model/entity send, through the Controller, to the View. Attributes obtained in the jsp ${}, remember to add the Annotations, @Controller @RequestMapping, @Service, it use such Annotationa to set up the each layer including the controller.
　　　　


Presentation/View Layer, in the view directory
	The ‘view’ directory contains the view layer pages in the ../ WEB-INF/view.
	The ‘error’ directory contains the error pages. The pages that have not been complete designed could also be directed to these pages.
	The ‘static’ directory contains the css files and the third-party libraries

Database Layer
It uses MySql as database
	Database specification is in the db directory which includes tables and attributes.
